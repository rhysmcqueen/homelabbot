This homelab discord bot was something I threw together to have some fun.
At the moment it does the follow (in a mostly working fasion)
* Ping Test (Ping any host on the network or the internet and return the results)
* Create a database full of hosts (used for IPs, MAC address and more)
* Hello world command (just says hello back)
* Wake on lan (uses the macs in the data base to wake on lan hosts)
* Shows the details on a host (Pulls from the data base)
* Counter command (starts a counter and every time someone presses the button it increases)
* Timer (starts a time since a friends would always say be on in 5 and never will get on in 5)
* Sends power on and off commands to a smart plug that powers my raspbery pi (needs to be rebooted alot...)


  
What else could I add:
* Proxmox commands via the API?
* Terraform commands to deploy stacks?
* Ansible commands?
* If you look in the scratch pad folder you will see I made the discord bot act as a SSH client... Cool idea but supper insecure.
